## Live Share
[Live share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) is VS code extension that provides great pair programing experience.

It enables port tunneling, so every participant can access host's services as they are their own localhost ports. This happens to be great when working with designer or someone who doesn't have dev environment set up locally.

### Installation

1. Download and install the Visual Studio Live Share extension for Visual Studio Code.

2. Wait for the extension to finish downloading and then reload VS Code when prompted.

3. Wait for Visual Studio Live Share to finish installing dependencies (you'll see progress updates in the status bar).

4. Once complete, you'll see `Live Share` appear in your status bar.
